		<h1>Burrowing Owl</h1>
		<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrowing_Owl">Burrowing Owl</a> (Athene cunicularia) is a small, long-legged owl found throughout open landscapes of North and South America. Burrowing owls can be found in grasslands, rangelands and deserts.</p>
		<p>Unlike most owls, burrowing owls are often active during the day, although they tend to avoid the mid-day heat. Most hunting is still done from dusk until dawn, when their owl apomorphies are most advantageous.</p>
